<h4 id="delete-data">How Can You Delete Your Data or Account?</h4>

<%# <h5 id="delete-map">Delete my maps</h5>
<p>Go to the Edit tab of the map you want to delete and click on the "Delete this map" link. This will delete the map from our servers, however, note that maps are publicly available; deleting a map from our servers will not ensure that every copy of it is deleted, since others may have copied or reused the image prior to deletion. If you delete your account, all the maps that you have uploaded are also deleted. This is not reversible. </p> %>

<h5 id="delete-contributions">Delete my contributions</h5>
<p>Your contributions are open and public. You can manually delete your contributions, but they will still be recorded in the activity tab of the application. For example, if you put control points on a map and later delete them, the activity tab of the map will show the creation and deletion of the control points and may let other users revert your changes. You cannot wipe out your contributions on others maps, however deleting one of your own maps will delete the contributions associated with it.   It’s important to understand that mapwarper is not able to find, delete, or de-identify any copies of your contributions that other users may have created. </p>


<h5 id="delete account">Delete Account</h5>
<p>
  Users can delete their account at any time, by clicking on the <%= link_to 'settings link', edit_user_registration_path %> to open your user settings, and clicking the "cancel my account" button. <br />   
  Deleting your account will also delete any uploaded maps, and any contributions made associated with each map.
